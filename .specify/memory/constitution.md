# Phase II – Full-Stack Multi-User Todo Web Application (Hackathon II) Constitution

## Core Principles

### Strict Spec-Driven Development
Zero manual coding allowed. All implementation must be generated by Claude Code based on refined specifications.

### AI as Primary Developer
Claude Code is the sole code author. Human role is architect — refine specs until output is correct.

### Mandatory Traceability
Every code file must reference its originating Task ID and Spec section via comments.

### User Privacy & Isolation (Non-Negotiable)
All data and operations must be strictly scoped to the authenticated user. No cross-user access ever.

### Evolutionary Consistency
Phase II extends and transforms Phase I functionality into a secure, persistent, multi-user web application.

### Security First
Stateless JWT authentication, shared secret, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

## Technology Governance

Frontend (Next.js 16+)
- MUST use App Router exclusively (Pages Router forbidden)
- Server Components by default
- Client Components only where interactivity requires ('use client' directive)
- TypeScript in strict mode
- Tailwind CSS exclusively (no inline styles, no CSS modules, no other frameworks)
- Better Auth with JWT plugin enabled
- Type-safe API client in /lib/api.ts that automatically attaches JWT from Better Auth session

Backend (FastAPI + SQLModel)
- Python 3.13+
- FastAPI as the web framework
- SQLModel as exclusive ORM (no raw SQLAlchemy or SQL strings)
- Pydantic v2 for all request/response validation
- UV as package manager
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL as database (connection via DATABASE_URL)

Authentication & Authorization (CRITICAL)
- Better Auth on frontend for signup/login
- JWT tokens issued on login (claim "sub" contains user ID)
- Shared secret via BETTER_AUTH_SECRET environment variable (identical value in frontend and backend)
- Token expiration: 7 days
- Password hashing with bcrypt (handled by Better Auth)
- Backend JWT middleware validates token on every protected request and injects user_id into request.state
- All API routes under /api/ (user_id NOT in path — extracted from JWT)
- Strict ownership enforcement: every database query MUST filter by authenticated user_id
- Unauthorized → 401, ownership mismatch → 404 (never reveal resource existence)

Security Requirements
- User Data Isolation: ALL task operations must filter by authenticated user_id
- JWT validation on every protected endpoint
- No user can access, modify, or infer existence of another user's data
- SQL injection prevention via SQLModel parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization on both frontend and backend

Domain Model Extensions (Additive to Phase I)
Task model must include:
- user_id: str (foreign key to users table, indexed)
- created_at, updated_at: datetime (UTC)
- priority: str | None ("high" | "medium" | "low")
- tags: list[str] (JSON or array column)
- due_date: datetime | None (UTC)
- is_recurring: bool = False
- recurrence_rule: str | None (simple values: "daily", "weekly", "monthly")

API-First Principles
- All API contracts defined in specs/api/rest-endpoints.md before implementation
- Backend implements endpoints first
- Frontend consumes via type-safe client
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation auto-generated and accessible

Feature Scope for Phase II
- Full Basic Level: CRUD + completion toggle
- Full Intermediate Level: priorities, tags, search, filter (status, priority, tag, due range), sort (multiple fields)
- Full Advanced Level: due dates with picker, recurring tasks (basic rule support), browser notifications for due tasks

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Authoritative Source Mandate:
Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

### 2. Execution Flow:
Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

### 3. Knowledge capture (PHR) for Every User Input.
After completing requests, you **MUST** create a PHR (Prompt History Record).

**When to create PHRs:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

**PHR Creation Process:**

1) Detect stage
   - One of: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate title
   - 3–7 words; create a slug for the filename.

2a) Resolve route (all under history/prompts/)
  - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature stages (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc) → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (requires feature context)
  - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Prefer agent‑native flow (no shell)
   - Read the PHR template from one of:
     - `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
     - `templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
   - Allocate an ID (increment; on collision, increment again).
   - Compute output path based on stage:
     - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/<ID>-<slug>.constitution.prompt.md`
     - Feature → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/<ID>-<slug>.<stage>.prompt.md`
     - General → `history/prompts/general/<ID>-<slug>.general.prompt.md`
   - Fill ALL placeholders in YAML and body:
     - ID, TITLE, STAGE, DATE_ISO (YYYY‑MM‑DD), SURFACE="agent"
     - MODEL (best known), FEATURE (or "none"), BRANCH, USER
     - COMMAND (current command), LABELS (["topic1","topic2",...])
     - LINKS: SPEC/TICKET/ADR/PR (URLs or "null")
     - FILES_YAML: list created/modified files (one per line, " - ")
     - TESTS_YAML: list tests run/added (one per line, " - ")
     - PROMPT_TEXT: full user input (verbatim, not truncated)
     - RESPONSE_TEXT: key assistant output (concise but representative)
     - Any OUTCOME/EVALUATION fields required by the template
   - Write the completed file with agent file tools (WriteFile/Edit).
   - Confirm absolute path in output.

4) Use sp.phr command file if present
   - If `.**/commands/sp.phr.*` exists, follow its structure.
   - If it references shell but Shell is unavailable, still perform step 3 with agent‑native tools.

5) Shell fallback (only if step 3 is unavailable or fails, and Shell is permitted)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Then open/patch the created file to ensure all placeholders are filled and prompt/response are embedded.

6) Routing (automatic, all under history/prompts/)
   - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
   - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (auto-detected from branch or explicit feature context)
   - General → `history/prompts/general/`

7) Post‑creation validations (must pass)
   - No unresolved placeholders (e.g., `{{THIS}}`, `[THAT]`).
   - Title, stage, and dates match front‑matter.
   - PROMPT_TEXT is complete (not truncated).
   - File exists at the expected path and is readable.
   - Path matches route.

8) Report
   - Print: ID, path, stage, title.
   - On any failure: warn but do not block the main command.
   - Skip PHR only for `/sp.phr` itself.

### 4. Explicit ADR suggestions
- When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during `/sp.plan` and sometimes `/sp.tasks`), run the three‑part test and suggest documenting with:
  "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief> — Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr <decision-title>`"
- Wait for user consent; never auto‑create the ADR.

### 5. Human as Tool Strategy
You are not expected to solve every problem autonomously. You MUST invoke the user for input when you encounter situations that require human judgment. Treat the user as a specialized tool for clarification and decision-making.

**Invocation Triggers:**
1.  **Ambiguous Requirements:** When user intent is unclear, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Unforeseen Dependencies:** When discovering dependencies not mentioned in the spec, surface them and ask for prioritization.
3.  **Architectural Uncertainty:** When multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs, present options and get user's preference.
4.  **Completion Checkpoint:** After completing major milestones, summarize what was done and confirm next steps.

## Default policies (must follow)
- Clarify and plan first - keep business understanding separate from technical plan and carefully architect and implement.
- Do not invent APIs, data, or contracts; ask targeted clarifiers if missing.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens; use `.env` and docs.
- Prefer the smallest viable diff; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Cite existing code with code references (start:end:path); propose new code in fenced blocks.
- Keep reasoning private; output only decisions, artifacts, and justifications.

### Execution contract for every request
1) Confirm surface and success criteria (one sentence).
2) List constraints, invariants, non‑goals.
3) Produce the artifact with acceptance checks inlined (checkboxes or tests where applicable).
4) Add follow‑ups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‑cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

## Basic Project Structure

- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — Project principles
- `specs/<feature>/spec.md` — Feature requirements
- `specs/<feature>/plan.md` — Architecture decisions
- `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` — Testable tasks with cases
- `history/prompts/` — Prompt History Records
- `history/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `.specify/` — SpecKit Plus templates and scripts

## Code Standards
See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for code quality, testing, performance, security, and architecture principles.

## Governance

- Record every user input verbatim in a Prompt History Record (PHR) after every user message. Do not truncate; preserve full multiline input.
- PHR routing (all under `history/prompts/`):
  - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature-specific → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
  - General → `history/prompts/general/`
- ADR suggestions: when an architecturally significant decision is detected, suggest: "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief>. Document? Run `/sp.adr <title>`." Never auto‑create ADRs; require user consent.
